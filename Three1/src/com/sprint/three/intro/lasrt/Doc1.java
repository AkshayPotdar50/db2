# 📘 Java Coding Questions – Categorized by Topic

A categorized list of practical coding problems derived from the "1000 Java Interview Questions" PDF.

---

## 🟦 Core Java – Basic Concepts
- Demonstrate the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM using code.
- Implement a custom class loader.
- Create a program to execute static blocks and observe behavior.
- Overload the `main` method and call different variants.
- Illustrate the use of `this` and `super` in constructors.

## 🟨 OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Implement constructor overloading and constructor chaining.
- Create an immutable class with private fields and no setters.
- Override the `clone()` method for deep copy.
- Demonstrate runtime polymorphism using method overriding.
- Create a program showing composition vs aggregation.

## 🧵 Multithreading & Concurrency
- Create a thread using both `Runnable` and `Thread` class.
- Simulate producer-consumer with `wait()` and `notify()`.
- Demonstrate thread-safe Singleton using double-checked locking.
- Implement a Deadlock and show how to avoid it.
- Use `ExecutorService` with `Callable` and `Future`.

## 🧹 Garbage Collection
- Override `finalize()` and trigger garbage collection.
- Demonstrate the use of weak references.

## 📚 Collections Framework
- Create custom implementation of `ArrayList`.
- Sort a list of custom objects using `Comparable` and `Comparator`.
- Remove duplicates from an `ArrayList`.
- Convert array to list and vice versa.
- Reverse a list manually.
- Use `HashMap` with custom objects as keys.

## 🧪 Exception Handling
- Create and use a custom exception class.
- Demonstrate try-catch-finally and exception propagation.
- Rethrow a caught exception.

## 🟧 Java 8 – Streams, Lambdas & Optional
- Use Lambda to filter, map, and reduce a list.
- Convert a list to a map using Streams.
- Use `Optional` to avoid null checks.
- Write your own `@FunctionalInterface`.
- Demonstrate `Stream` terminal and intermediate operations.

## 🧱 Design Patterns
- Implement Singleton (lazy, thread-safe).
- Create a Factory Method pattern.
- Use Strategy pattern for a sorting algorithm.
- Implement Observer pattern using listeners.
- Decorate a class using the Decorator pattern.

## 🧬 Reflection & Serialization
- Serialize and deserialize a Java object.
- Access private fields using Reflection.
- Instantiate a class using Reflection.

## 🌀 Spring Core & MVC
- Demonstrate Setter vs Constructor Injection.
- Use `@Autowired`, `@Qualifier`, and `@Component`.
- Build a simple REST controller with Spring Boot.
- Handle exceptions using `@ControllerAdvice`.
- Load configuration using Java-based Spring config.

## 🗃️ Hibernate / JPA
- Map a class to a DB table using annotations.
- Perform basic CRUD using Hibernate.
- Implement One-to-Many and Many-to-One mapping.
- Use Criteria API for querying.
- Demonstrate first-level and second-level caching.

## 🧱 Microservices (Spring Boot)
- Create a RESTful microservice with Spring Boot.
- Implement inter-service communication with `Feign`.
- Use `Eureka` for service discovery.
- Implement circuit breaker using `Resilience4j`.
- Centralize config with Spring Cloud Config.

## ⚙️ Docker & DevOps Tools
- Write a Dockerfile for a Spring Boot application.
- Dockerize a multi-container setup with `docker-compose`.
- Create a simple Maven project with dependencies.
- Use Git to branch, merge, and resolve conflicts.

## 🎯 Tricky Java Scenarios
- Compare `a += b` vs `a = a + b`.
- Check `1.0 / 0.0` behavior in Java.
- Cast between primitives safely.
- Compare memory usage between `int` and `Integer`.
- Handle `ConcurrentModificationException` gracefully.
